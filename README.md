The code will not run on replit due to memory constraints provided by the cloud software. Do note that when run, text may be improperly shifted due to a change in monitor size. Eg, when i am editing on my laptop it looks fine, however importing to my computer shifts the text over itself.
Before running (assuming you are using Visual Studios) Make sure to install and import processing's core.jar into the reference library folder. The library download can be found here https://processing.org/.
